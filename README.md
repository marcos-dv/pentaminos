# Pentaminos Project MIPS

Pentaminos are geometric figures composed of 5 squares, as tetraminos (tetris figures) are composed of 4 squares.

This Pentaminos-Tetris written in MIPS allows you to simulate this harder version of the famous game.

Feel free to change the code and improve your own tetris.
